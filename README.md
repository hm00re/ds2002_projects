# ds2002_projects - Project 1
Helena Moore 

**Files:**

All files for Project 1 are located in the "midterm" folder. 

SQL files for creating the original source sakila database are located in the "sakila-db" folder, inside of "midterm".

The JSON file source for this project is located in the "data" folder, inside of "midterm".


**Instructions:**

Run files in "sakila-db" folder to create source database. 

If there is a pre-existing database named "sakila_dw" in your MySQL workbench, drop this database before proceeding to the next step.

Run hm_project1.ipynb as a jupyter notebook, and run midterm_Create_Populate_Dim_Date.sql when directed to by hm_project1.ipynb. This performs the ETL pipeline for the dimensional datamart sakila_dw, and demonstrates functionality through aggregate SQL queries.
